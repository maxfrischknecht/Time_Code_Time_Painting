# Time Code
I followed Yoko Ono's instructions and created a time painting. The computational drawing is present, but will only be visible at a certain point during the day for a very short period. To illustrate the changing light conditions, the color of the painting is evolving over a 24h cycle showing 360 different colors. Can you find out the time?
